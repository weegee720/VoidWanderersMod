	<text>A few merchant ships pass nearby but they are either ignoring your hails or their computer isn't designed to work through the same frequencies...</text>
	<text>A number of civilian ships seem to be evacuating a small colony. One ship messages you before jumping away, "Damn you aliens! This is why we closed that long-ranged beacon in the first place!"</text>

	Others events necessary for strucrtural stuff
------------>

<event name="START_BEACON_ENGI">
	<text load="START_BEACON_ENGI"/>
</event>
<textList name="START_BEACON_ENGI">
	<text>You have arrived in Engi space. The Mantis have been threatening the Engi core worlds, but you should be able to stock up for your journey.</text>
	<text>You have arrived in Engi space. The fall of the Federation has brought tough times for these robotic lifeforms, but they're usually willing to help.</text>
</textList>

<event name="STORE_ENGI">
	<text load="STORE_ENGI"/>
	<store/>
</event>
<textList name="STORE_ENGI">
	<text>The Engi can do remarkable things with just a pile of scrap. The Engi hive at this beacon are selling equipment for just that.</text>
	<text>A message arrives: "Your scrap, ours. Our weapons for you." You're about to raise the shields when you realise it's just an Engi trader looking for a trade.</text>
	<text>An Engi ship hails: "Engine upgrade necessary for travel home. Sale of equipment necessary for engine upgrade."</text>
</textList>

<event name="NOTHING_ENGI">
	<text load="NOTHING_ENGI"/>
</event>
<textList name="NOTHING_ENGI">
	<text>The complex arrangements of ship hulls and FTL drive capacitors floating abandoned in space suggest the Engi were here not too long ago; but no longer.</text>
	<text>You arrive at a green planet with great plains and rolling waterfalls. It would be of little interest to the Engi nearby.</text>  <!-- JUSTIN TO DO-  MAKE GREEN PLANET-->
	<text>You have arrived near an Engi construction yard.  Most Engi's maintain their bi-pedal appearance out of habit but here you see a number of Engi hives working together to create massive organic machines adept at building ships.  Truly a sight to behold.</text>
	<text>Even though each "individual" Engi is made up of trillions of nano-machines, their culture still revolves around traditional social interactions.  A nearby station seems to be constructed for entertainment of passing Engi travellers.</text>
	<text>You see a number of Engi space stations and fleets nearby.  Despite looking like piles of junk loosely tied together they are actually a model of efficiency.  They just lack a certain aesthetic emphasis in their constructions.</text>
	<text>This system appears quite peaceful.  You're not sure how long it'll last between the combined threats of the Rebels and Mantis.</text>
	<text>There are a number of merchant ships passing through the area despite the threat of Mantis invasion.  No doubt interested in buying the efficient technology of the Engi.</text>
	<text>You see a small Rebel carrier in the distance.  You lay low and try to blend in with the other traffic.  However it's surprising to see a Rebel military ship alone deep in Engi space.</text>
	<text>The Engi seem to have avoided this particular node, along with every other life-form. You keep your eyes peeled for reasons why, but spin up the FTL without event.</text>
	<text>A cluster of Engi satellites in orbit of a nearby planet are the only clue the mechanical species was ever here.   You have other places to be.</text>

<textList name="ENGI_GIFT">
	<text>An Engi vessel hails you. "Identity: Federation? Outlier probability. Implies... revival. Implies... hope.  Assistance suggested."  They offer some supplies.</text>
	<text>You cross paths with an Engi cargo vessel hurrying home before the Mantis fleets attempt to take over this sector. They're happy to offload some of their cargo to get home faster.</text>
	<text>You make contact with an isolated Engi science station who are staying put despite the likelihood of Mantis invasion. They suggest you trial some experimental technology.</text>
	<text>This was the site of a recent battle. Either a show of Mantis force, or the Engi here weren't disposed to go peacefully. You pick through the pieces.</text>
</textList>

<event name="ENGI_FLEET_DELAY" unique="true">
	<text>You notice an Engi colony hiding on the other side of a nearby moon. It turns out they're excavating an equipment cache from the Federation-Mantis War, and they suggest it might be used to lure the pursuing rebel fleet.</text>

	</event>
	<event>
		<text>The Engi are satisfied with your explanation. "Beneficial. Subject goal: long, long journey. Remains compatible with transfer of goods from Engi." They send over the gear willingly, and you feel better for it.</text>

	<text>You come across a Mantis raider taking pot shots at a defenceless Engi supply station. Discovering its weapons aren't much of a match for the station's armour, it turns on your ship.   Battlestations!</text>

	<text>Long range scanners indicate the Rebel fleet has temporarily paused its advance on your position. Your decision to leave the distress beacon deactivated was farsighted.</text>
	<text>Scanners show that the Rebel fleet has ceased its pursuit for a short time.</text>
	<text>Your intuition as captain is telling you that the Rebels are having a hard time trying to find your ship.</text>
	<text>Without a distress beacon or any FTL signatures to trace, you're sure that the Rebels are struggling to find you.  You can only hope their confusion lasts until more fuel can be found.</text>

	<text>Small traffic passes within a short distance of you, but no one responds to your hails.</text>
	<text>The only ship within hailing range appears to be a civilian vessel. However, it quickly leaves once it picks up your signal.</text>
	<text>As you wait, a small asteroid storm pelts softly against your shields and hull.</text>
	<text>You begin to wonder if turning on the beacon would be worth the risk of detection.  The fleet slowly approaches.</text>
	<text>You contemplate the vastness of space.</text>
	<text>The prolonged wait in empty space is causing tension among the crew. Still no contact.</text>

		STRUCTURE!!!
	Others events necessary for strucrtural stuff
------------>

<event name="START_BEACON_MANTIS">
	<text>You've entered a poorly charted area of space that's known to be home to the Mantis.  Ensure your hull plating is up to scratch and that you have enough fuel in the tank to make it through.</text>
</event>

<event name="STORE_MANTIS">
	<text load="STORE_MANTIS"/>
	<store/>
</event>
<textList name="STORE_MANTIS">
	<text>Upon arriving at the beacon, you're hailed by a well-spoken Mantis, "Hail, traveler.  These are dangerous times.  Perhaps you find yourself in need of our services?"  He appears to be a trader.</text>
	<text>Uncertain about what you'll discover at this beacon, you scan the surroundings.   You detect several warnings on wide-band channels discouraging any violence in protected trade-space.  Perhaps you can find some wares nearby.</text>
	<text>Merchants are not highly respected among the Mantis race, so few undertake the profession.  You're mildly surprised to receive an advertisement from a nearby space dock.  You decide to see what they have to offer.</text>
	<text>Identifying a Mantis trading post ahead, you signal them so that your approach won't be taken as a threat. The leader hails you: "You have scrap? Quickly, come dock before the warriors see you."</text>
	<text>A struggling Mantis cargo ship headed for the node raises what's left of shields as you jump in. You power up your weapons as a show of force, and they reluctantly agree to offload some of their cargo to you - for a price.</text>
	<text>The rebels are already here! The crew braces for impact, but none comes. The sensors report the unmanned rebel supply ship is malfunctioning and is stuck in vending mode - for a little scrap you can take your pick.</text>
</textList>

<event name="NOTHING_MANTIS">
	<text load="NOTHING_MANTIS"/>
</event>
<textList name="NOTHING_MANTIS">
	<text>At this point you almost expect a fight with the Mantis, but this beacon appears to be entirely devoid of other ships.   You take the time to catch your breath and double check the ship's systems.</text>
	<text>The only thing this beacon offers is a view of deep space and a brief respite from battles. For some this must be a welcome refuge. </text>
	<text>A nearby Mantis mining operation is clearly using heavy Engi slave labor.  You briefly consider the possibility of emancipating the slaves, but the Mantis presence is too formidable.  You decide to lay low.</text>
	<text>There aren't so many parts of Mantis space that aren't dotted by the wrecks of battles past, but this is one of them. You take a deep breath and prepare to move on.</text>
	<text>There's nothing here but space debris and some uninhabitable planetoids.</text>
	<text>You fancy you see something moving in the shadow of the beacon, but all remains still.</text>

<textList name="MANTIS_FIGHT">
	<!-- These are the ones that I had written-->
	<text>A Mantis military ship appears on local radar alongside the remains of a human freighter.  Prepare for a hostile encounter!</text>
	<text>A Mantis military scout hails your ship.  "Foolish alien!  Your kind has stifled our greatness for too long!  You will rue the day you backed the Federation!"</text>
	<text>A small Mantis cruiser is broadcasting a repeating message on a wide-band frequency, "All non-Mantis ships that enter our territory are forfeit.  Lower your shields and surrender if you value your lives."</text>
	<text>You detect a small military outpost and a few freighters nearby.  This mineral rich planet in an isolated location would be perfect for an illegal Mantis mining operation.  As you consider your options, a ship launches from the outpost. Prepare for a fight.</text>
	<text>You discover yet another unlicensed and uncharted Mantis colony.  They certainly waste no time expanding their claims.  A Mantis ship moves to intercept you before you can jump away.</text>
	<text>A Mantis military scout seems to have just finished a salvage op on a nearby wreck.  They have no time to waste with warnings and appear to wish to fight.</text>
	<text>A small military craft hails you and a Mantis captain appears on your receiver.  "All local human colonies have been punished for the Federation's transgressions.  Submit to processing."</text>
	<!-- These are the ones by tom-->
	<text>A nearby Mantis ship begins aggressive maneuvers.   You prepare for the worst.</text>
	<text>A stream of clicks and gurgling comes on the comm from a hostile Mantis scout.  The universal translator might be on the blink, but his intent is obvious.</text>
	<text>The Mantis ship is pleased to see you, and fires up its weapon systems.</text>
	<text>You recognize the outline of a Mantis ship against the blackness. Engage!</text>
	<text>Something red looms. It's the Mantis.</text>
	<text>A Mantis vessel hails you. "This hail is merely a distraction!" You notice their shields and weapons have come online.</text>
	<text>You notice a flurry of laser fire glance by the port window. The Mantis are upon you.</text>
	<text>The Mantis hail you. Their captain says, "I claim this vessel for my clan. Good hunting!"</text>
	<text>A Mantis female comes on the vidscreen.  The females don't make it to authority unless they're particularly vicious.  You power the weapons.</text>
	<text>A Mantis ship with the markings of a warrior tribe breaks position and attacks!</text>
	<text>A Mantis ship hails: "Ah! Fine prey. Fine prey! We honour you with our most eviscerating arsenal!" You sense a cloud to this silver lining and power the weapons.</text>
	<text>Children on Earth are told terrible tales of the blood red Mantis invasion ships - much like the one bearing down on you now - which once threatened the planet. You order weapons free!</text>
	<text>A youthful-looking Mantis captain hails. "You, prey, must know. Your death, Kaaazthwak's final kill before maturity. Kaaazthwak pay respects." Seems respects in Mantis culture are paid with lasers.</text>

	<text>This nebula must have been an important hub at one point; placing all of these jump beacons would be no easy task.  However, now it's hardly navigable.</text>
	<text>Nebulas were always dangerous places. Many electronics fail in these clouds. You will have to tread lightly.</text>
	<text>You've entered a sector thick with nebulas. You'll have to navigate on instinct.</text>
	<text>You've entered a nebula-rich sector. You may put a few light years on the fleet, but that's only useful if you make it out the other side.</text>
	<text>Thanks to the high nebula density of this sector very little of it has been charted, and rumours of what lurks in the depths abound.</text>
	<text>The gases that make up the nebulas in this sector threaten to impair your systems; but you have to press on.</text>

	<text>The centre of a hydrogen cloud doesn't seem like a very usual place for a store, but the Engi aren't a usual species. Wouldn't hurt to take a look.</text>
	<text>An Engi cargo vessel hails: "Propose mutually beneficial exchange of properties." That smells like a bargain.</text>
	<text>You discover a cluster of Federation refugee ships taking shelter in the folds of the nebula. "I'm sorry we've got nothing to give you, but we need scrap to keep the engines running." You sense they'll strike a trade.</text>

	<text>Your crew are constantly looking out of the windows, checking for hostiles. They jump at every creak and moan of the ship. The tension is almost palpable...</text>
	<text>You nervously glance out the windows but the only thing to greet you is more clouds and silence.</text>
	<text>You cycle through wide-band com channels as soon as you arrive. Nothing but static.</text>
	<text>With the sensors down, you spend a good deal of time staring out the window. It is, you must admit, rather beautiful here.</text>
	<text>There's nothing here, save for vast swirls of gas reflecting rays from a distant sun.</text>
